# Euler

My attempts at project Euler

Each problem is separated by folder with a main file for giving the answer.

The main folder includes one file for running all main files (`get_answer.py`) outputting the answer in 
textfiles for each folder and a benchmark script (`benchmark.py`) to check the average running time over 1000 
trials for each main file and outputting it in the same folder.
