# Euler

My attempts at project Euler

Each problem is separated by folder with a scripts for giving the answer.

The main folder includes one file for running all scripts (`main.py`) outputting the answers in 
a csv aloong with a timing if it is enabled.
I sometimes have multiple scripts for the same problem then all that has a `main()` function will be run. I change it to `main_()` if I dont want it run (for example because it is slow).
